# Tomato Disease Classifiction
In this project I trained a Deep Learning model on tomato leaves to classify diseases based on [Kaggle Tomato leaves data](https://www.kaggle.com/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf). In total we have 10 categories: 9 diseases and healthy tomatoes.For each category, there are 10k images to train and 1k images to test our model. All the images have been resized by 64x64 before uploading to the workspace to reduce the size of zip folder containing the images. <br />The project contains 2 notebooks: <br />
* Modelling notebook - for reading and processing the images and training our model <br />
* GUI notebook - for creating user interface so that users can upload tomato leaf images (allowed file formats: jpg, jpeg, png, bmp) and use predict button to see the diseases their tomatoes have
